                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Nada, and I am a student at UC Berkeley, though I am originally
                    from NYC. I am majoring in computer science, and minoring in sustainable design.
                    I have a passion for computer science, sustainability, and education, and am
                    especially interested in the intersection of those subjects.</p>
                <p>At my university, I have taken a variety of CS classes. I am a board
                    member of the Muslim Tech Collaborative (MTC), an organization dedicated
                    to fostering a community of Muslims in Tech. I have also participated in my
                    school's chapter of Society of Women Engineers. Otherwise, I am a developer
                    for MDB, Mobile Developers of Berkeley.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I paint, read, and listen to space podcasts. I love
                    creating things, no matter the domain. I volunteer often, especially in
                    education. I am currently a teacher at a bilingual school in upper Manhattan,
                    and during the school year, I teach art to students at a local elementary school.</p>
